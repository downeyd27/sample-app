## Synopsis

This project is Mike Hartl's Ruby on Rails tutorial intended to be a simple replication of twitter.  You have the ability to create an account where you can sign in and sign out with proper authentication and authorization.  You can also create "microposts", follow and unfollow other users, change a gravatar profile photo, and view a feed of the posts of those who you follow.  Manually updated from Rails 3 tutorial to Rails 4 environment.

## Motivation

This project was intended for me to further learn how to properly sign in a user with authentication and authorization along with emphasizing on test driven development.  This project gave me a lot of insight on separtion of concerns within the Ruby on Rails framework with helpers, partials, and a variety of gems new to me.
