# README

## Synopsis
This project is intended to be a simple replication of twitter.  You have the ability to make create an account where you can sign in and sign out with proper authentication and authorization.  You can also create "microposts", follow and unfollow other users, change a gravatar profile photo and view a feed of the posts of those who you follow.

## Motivation

This project was intended for me to further learn how to properly sign in a user with authentication and authorization along with emphasizing on test driven development.  This project also gave me practice on seperation of concerns and refactoring code.

## How to use

This app can be used [here](https://something-like-twitter.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.
